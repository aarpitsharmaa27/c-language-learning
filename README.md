# C Language Learning 🚀

Welcome to my C programming learning journey!  
This repository contains all the code files and examples I practice while learning C step by step.

## 📁 Structure

Each `.c` file focuses on one concept or topic.  
Files are named with numbers to maintain order.

### Example:
| File Name             | Description                        |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| `01_hello_world.c`    | My first C program                 |
| `02_variables.c`      | Understanding variables and types  |
| `03_input_output.c`   | Taking input and printing output   |
| `04_if_else.c`        | If-else statements                 |
| `05_loops.c`          | For, while, and do-while loops     |
| `...`                 | More coming as I learn             |

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download any `.c` file.
2. Compile using GCC or any C compiler:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output
   ./output
